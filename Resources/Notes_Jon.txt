We got this data set online and it covers all the songs that have been on the Top 200 Weekly (Global) charts of Spotify in 2020 & 2021. 

We decided to look at it and ask "What makes a popular song popular?"  We made some assumtions like if a song is more danceable or has a higher stream count it will probably be more popular.  

We compaired songs on their popularity value with:

tempo,
valance,
loudness,
energy,
stream count,
Danceability



The data had some issues with regards to running analysis on it to make comparisons on the popularity field (some had 0 and we felt had no bearing on "what makes a song popular").  
There were also a number of records with incomplete data and so we only wanted to use information from records that were complete.  Finally the genre info was storred in such a way that
it was really difficult to try and utilize matplotlib chart plotting so we had to reshape the genre data and explode it out into separate records to then be able to chart it with matplotlib.


based on the following correlations between popularity and things like tempo, 
valance (musical positiveness - higher values denote the song sounded happier where as lower values denote the song sounded sad or angry), 
dancability, energy, we can assert that infact our assumptions were true in that: A song that has a shorter duration, higher tempo, higher valance, higher energy, higher danceability is more popular.


Things we could look at further and explore with ML would be to be able to predict: Once an artist has a popular song, are more of that artists songs likely to become popular?

Things to look at further to explore rational would be to look at outliers and compare their data with the majority to see what things stand out (if anything) besides the indicator in question (i.e. Danceability)
